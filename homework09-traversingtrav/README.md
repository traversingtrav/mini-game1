5) this lab is an example of reuse through inheritance in that. 
In each of the subclasses water, grass, and fire we are able to call parent attributes without redfining a Pokemon.
for example in my classes I call type as the defending Pokemons type without redefining the defending Pokemon.
while in arena you can see an alternative method of making the pokemon a parameter and calling pokemon.attribut ie pokemon.name .
